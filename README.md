Code to accompany yoga practice
I am building a set of all code that can possibly help continue yoga practice

In the works are:

1) An audible voice to follow for anulom-vilom practice during coding breaks

2) A program that gives you URL's for pricing information of the yoga studios near you.  
   It saves you some steps in navigating each studio's website to find their pricing page!
   More features would be nice: open up the URL's, give a visual comparison of prices and distance from you
   But I haven't gotten there.
